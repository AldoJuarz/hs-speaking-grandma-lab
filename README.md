# Speak to Grandma

Write a speak_to_grandma method.

Whatever you say to grandma, she should respond with
HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY! unless you shout it (type in all capitals).

If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) 
and yells back.

NO, NOT SINCE 1938!

Need help figuring out how to use if/else statements? Check out the resources below.

##BONUS
Too easy? To make your program really believable, have grandma shout a different year each time; maybe any year at random between 1930 and 1950. (Hint: There is a ruby method that will generate random numbers.) 

###DOUBLE BONUS
Grandma keeps talking to you and won't let you leave until you shout BYE. (Hint: You will probably want to use a while loop to keep the program running.)

###TRIPLE BONUS
Grandma really doesn't want you to leave! When you shout BYE, she pretends not to hear you. Change your program so that you have to shout BYE three times in a row before the program will end. Make sure to test your program: if you shout BYE three times, but not in a row, you should still be talking to grandma.
