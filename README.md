## Speak to Grandma
#### This is a group/pair lab. Write out pseudocode first!

Write a `speak_to_grandma` method that accepts one argument - what you want to say to her.

Whatever you say to grandma, she should respond with
HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!
unless you shout it (type in all capitals).

If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) 
and yells back.

NO, NOT SINCE 1938!
